# Robot-Monitor-Software
This is a Windows based software that is used to communicate with a mobile robot and display the real-time telemetry information in x-y plots, bar graphs and other formats. The software is written in Visual Basic .NET, with Visual Studio 2019 community edition being used.
The codes and related resources are archived as Visual Studio project template, thus you can use Visual Studio to unarchive the ZIP file and rebuild the software.
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5212JX8CQ5g for a demonstration of the software with a mobile robot.
